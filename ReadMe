# 🧠 Gemini Agentic AI Practice Project

This repository is dedicated to my hands-on practice of **building AI agents** using the **Google Gemini API**.
The goal is to understand **how agentic architectures work** — from tool orchestration to reasoning, task planning, and real-time decision-making — while creating modular, production-ready agent frameworks.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a **multi-agent system** where each agent performs a specific role (e.g., data fetching, decision-making, analysis, or user interaction).
The system is designed to demonstrate **autonomous reasoning**, **task delegation**, and **tool usage** — the key capabilities of an intelligent agentic ecosystem.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

* Learn to build **modular AI agents** using the Gemini API
* Implement **autonomous task planning** and **tool integration**
* Understand **agent collaboration and communication**
* Deploy lightweight **multi-agent orchestration pipelines**
* Experiment with **real-world use cases** like:

  * Data enrichment & decision agents
  * Research assistants
  * Financial analysis bots
  * RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agents

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vijay-48/gemini-agentic-practice.git
   cd gemini-agentic-practice
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up Gemini API key:**

   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

4. **Run the project:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## 🧩 Current Focus

Practicing the **core agent lifecycle**:

1. Receive input
2. Plan and delegate
3. Use tools or APIs
4. Analyze responses
5. Return structured output

Each agent communicates through a shared memory structure that evolves dynamically during runtime.

## 🧭 Roadmap

* [x] Basic agent structure setup
* [ ] Add memory module
* [ ] Implement LangGraph-style workflow
* [ ] Integrate external APIs (e.g., finance, news, weather)
* [ ] Enable conversational context chaining
* [ ] Deploy on a small Streamlit dashboard
